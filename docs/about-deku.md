# About Deku

Decca is an implementation of [Deku] in <200 lines using [virtual-dom]. The full Deku v2 API is implemented (plus a little more)â€”you can use Decca while Deku v2.0.0 is in development.

## Differences with Deku

- `path` (see [Components](components.md)) in Deku is a dot-separated path of the component relative to its ancestors (eg, `aw398.0.0`). In Decca, `path` is simply a unique ID for the component instance (eg, `c83`). It fulfills the same function as a unique identifier.
